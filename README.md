A tool for skipping intro and outro for plex.

## Features
- identify outro start and end scanning the video for credits text.
- identify intro start and end using themes song or blackframes and audio silence.
- identify if the video has a recap using subtitles and audio.
- download theme songs.
- process on playback start.
- process on recently added.
- control the client to skip intro/outro.
- start next episode when the credits start.
- create chapter for intro and outro

## Install
You should install this from github as this project isnt stable.
```pip install -e git+https://github.com/Hellowlol/bw_plex.git#egg=bw_plex```
or using a docker ```docker pull hellowlol/bw_plex```. You may also need to `pip install Pillow wheel`.

*If* you have issues with `scipy` on FreeNAS, running
```
pkg install python3 py37-pip git lapack gcc libstdc++_stldoc_4.2.2 fortran-utils py37-wheel py37-llmvlite py37-numba py37-matplotlib py37-sqlite3
```
worked.  This is obtained from a similar issue around `scipy` on Apline linux [here](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9481#issuecomment-565184118), and from issues with `llmvlite`, `numba`, and `matplotlib` dependencies.  Obviously having to install these manually isn't ideal, but installing them using your package manager (rather than using `pip`) is best for figuring out any dependencies they have on your system.


## Usage
**Note:** This tool only works on your local network and use a 64 bit python install.

You can read the help for the subcommands using --help:
```bw_plex export_db --help```

The most common command is:
```bw_plex watch --url "http://....." -t "aaabb" ``` you can skip the url and token flags if you edit the config.ini

## Resources

The memory usage and especially the CPU can get very high. If you running bw_plex in a docker on a shared server consider adding resource constraints. For simple cpu constraints you can set the niceness with the nice flag `bw_plex --nice nicenesslevel command` 

## Configuration File

bw_plex automatically generates a default configuration file located at ```~/.config/bw_plex/config.ini```. Most of the entries have notes accompanying them explaining what each one does, and what the options are.

## How it works:

Bw_plex listens for playing events using websocket. We download the first 10 minutes of that episode and/or the theme music from YouTube/tvtunes/Plex.

We then create a audio print from the theme song that we match against the audio of the 10 minutes of the episode. (Thereâ€™s a backup method that uses audio silence in combination with black frames too).

We then check if this episode has a recap using subtitles and audio where we look for clues like last season, previously on (add you own words in the config), then we download last part of the episode an and indentify the start and end of the outro.

Depending on your settings we will then allow playback until the theme start or just jump straight to intro end if we also should skip recaps.

Since this is a rather slow process we also start processing the next episode so next time you watch the same show we instantly seek the client to the end of the theme.

## FAQ:

#### Why is `bw_plex` not working?

Check if Advertise as player "Allow other Plex apps to fling content to this device and control it remotely" is checked.  Ensure you are using the latest versions of Plex and/or your Plex client.  Ensure you are running Python 3.  (You can run this manually if you have both Python 2 and 3 installed: `python3 -m bw_plex watch foo`).

If all else fails, please consider submitting a [bug report](https://github.com/Hellowlol/bw_plex/issues/new).  *Please ensure you attach a log to this report.*

#### How can I enable whole show / season processing with `bw_plex`?
The prompt support python slicing. The format is `start:end:step`.  So say you want all episodes you just do `::` instead of a number.
I also added a way to just list the number you want: `1, 5, 9`  So the command would be
```
bw_plex process --name foo ::
```
or
```
bw_plex process --name foo 1, 5, 9
```
